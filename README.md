#### To Study
1. Linear Algebra - "*Before you do anything else, start boning up on your linear (matrix) algebra. This is the single most important thing you can do to get yourself bootstrapping your ML education.*"
   
#### Further Reading

#### Suggestions
1. Follow one single (note the double emphasis) book, don't be bogged with learning Linear Algebra first, easier to do it on the go
2. I'll soon start one project on Kaggle, anyone with me on this

#### My Progress
Introduction to Machine Learning - Ethem Alpaydin : <b>2</b> out of <b>19</b> chapters done 
Linear Algebra - Jim Ho Kwak : <b>0</b> out of <b>6</b> chapters done (book has 9 chapters, 6 are core of linear algebra)
